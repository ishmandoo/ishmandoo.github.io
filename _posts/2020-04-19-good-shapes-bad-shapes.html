    This weekend, I participated in <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46">Ludum Dare 46</a> a semiannual game
    jam. Matt, Zach, and I <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/good-shapes-bad-shapes">built a video game in
        48 hours</a> using <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>. I liked Godot a lot.
</p>
<p>
    Zach wrote the music, Matt made the art, I wrote the code, and we all designed the game. I'm very proud of how it
    came out.

    The theme of the jam was "Keep it alive". We built an abstract survival game called <i>Good Shapes, Bad Shapes</i>,
    where you play a glowing circle trying to avoid a set of evil polygons. The game is dark, mostly illuminated by
    light emitted by the player. The player's energy fades slowly over time, so to stay alive they must collect the
    glowing orbs which dart erratically around the level. While scrambling after these orbs in the dark, it's really
    easy to run into one of these assholes:

<table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 25%;text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/img/2020/04/triangle.png"
                style="height: 110px;"></img></td>
        <td>The triangle rotates to track the player and quickly shoots at them when locked on.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 25%;text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/img/2020/04/square.png"
                style="height: 110px;"></img></td>
        <td>The square relentlessly pursues the player by moving side to side or up and down.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 25%;text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/img/2020/04/pentagon.png"
                style="height: 110px;"></img></td>
        <td>The pentagon teleports repeatedly and unpredictably to locations in a ring around surrounding player.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 25%;text-align: center; border-bottom: none;"><img src="/assets/img/2020/04/hexagon.png"
                style="height: 110px;"></img></td>
        <td style="border-bottom: none;">The hexagon bounces around the map and suddenly expands when a player gets
            near.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br />
<p>
    All of these shapes resemble the walls of the map itself, making it hard to tell what's safe and what isn't. I think
    the game works well, hard as it is. I've never gotten to 60 seconds.
