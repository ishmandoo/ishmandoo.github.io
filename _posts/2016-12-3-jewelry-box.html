<p>Over Thanksgiving, Matt and I made a jewelry box. It's 5-3/8" by 10-3/4", made of walnut and oak with a hinged lid and finger joint corners. Here's how we did it.</p>

<p>Below are the basic plans.</p>

<br/>
<p>We started by using our <a href="/woodworking/2016/11/29/router-based-planer.html">new planer</a> to thin some 1" nominal oak and walnut boards down to 3/8".  </p>

<br/>
<p>Using the table saw, we ripped them to their final widths of 3-3/8" for the front and sides or 3" for the back. </p>

<p>We cut them to their final lengths and then got to work on the finger joints. We used a clever jig to make accurate finger joints. You can see how it works in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTd81dlRQiE">this video</a> It requires a dado stack and an accurately cut square peg. It took us some time to lock in the precise width of the dado stack by adding and removing shims.</p>

<p>We cut the lid to size using the table saw for the basic shape. We used a jig saw to create the tab. We then cut a notch into the front piece to make way for the tab. For the bottom, we cut a 1/8" thick piece of oak to 10" by 5-3/4" and cut slots in the front and back panels for the bottom. Then we made sure everything fit.</p>

<p>We sanded all the panels with 80 and 200 grit sand paper, then glued it up and clamped it in place.</p>

<p>We gave it a final sanding and then rubbed some finishing wax into the wood to protect it. </p>
