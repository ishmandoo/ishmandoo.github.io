<p>An AD 9850BRS is an IC that lets you create radio frequency waveforms. The output frequency is controlled by a serial connection. Phil bought a board that includes one and some control circuitry. It's labeled HC-SR08. We were eventually able to get it working.</p>
<p>Here's&nbsp;what it looks like:</p>

<p>We used an Arduino Due, which runs at 3.3V, but from looking at the data sheet for the chip, I think it should work on 5V Arduinos as well. We ended up using <a href="https://github.com/F4GOJ/AD9850" target="_blank">this Arduino library</a>. We connected the following pins on the daughter board to the Arduino: </p>
<ul>
<li>W_CLK &nbsp; -> &nbsp; 7 </li>
<li>FQ_UD &nbsp; -> &nbsp; 8 </li>
<li>DATA &nbsp; -> &nbsp; 9 </li>
<li>RESET &nbsp; -> &nbsp; 10</li>
<li>VCC &nbsp; -> &nbsp; 3.3V</li>
<li>GND &nbsp; -> &nbsp; GND</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>We found the example code in that Github to be silly. This worked for us:</p>
<p>
  {% highlight c %}
  #include <AD9850.h>

  const int W_CLK_PIN = 7;
  const int FQ_UD_PIN = 8;
  const int DATA_PIN = 9;
  const int RESET_PIN = 10;

  double freq = 4000000;
  double trimFreq = 124999500;

  int phase = 0;

  void setup(){
    DDS.begin(W_CLK_PIN, FQ_UD_PIN, DATA_PIN, RESET_PIN);
    DDS.calibrate(trimFreq);
    DDS.up();
    DDS.setfreq(freq, phase);
  }

  void loop(){
  }
{% endhighlight %}</p>
