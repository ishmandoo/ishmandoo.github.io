I thought of a fun puzzle while I was at a conference in Downtown LA.

You're in a city with perfectly square blocks. You're trying to meet your boss at a restaurant two blocks north and three blocks east. You come to an intersection. You've got a walk signal going north, and a don't walk signal going east, with a big red timer counting down. Which way do you go?

Maybe you're thinking it doesn't matter? You're right, but also wrong. You can save a few seconds on average if you make the right choice.
